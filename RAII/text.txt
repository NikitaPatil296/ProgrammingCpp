RAII stands for Resource Acquisition Is Initialization.
A resource (like memory, file handles, mutexes, sockets, etc.) is acquired in a constructor.
The resource is released in the destructor.


Why use RAII?

Prevents resource leaks (memory, file handles, locks, etc.).
Simplifies code since cleanup is automatic.
Works seamlessly with stack unwinding (when exiting a scope due to normal execution or exceptions).
